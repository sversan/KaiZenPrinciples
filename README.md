# Kaizen Principle 🚀

✅ Kaizen (改善): Small, continuous improvements lead to long-term success.
✅ Ikigai (生き甲斐): Align your work with your personal purpose for lasting motivation.
✅ Shinrin-yoku (森林浴): Spending time in nature to refresh the mind and reduce stress.
✅ Harahachibu (腹八分): Avoid extremes—balance effort and rest to maintain consistent energy.
✅ Nemawashi (根回し): Thoughtful groundwork and consensus-building before making decisions lead to smoother execution.
✅ Pomodoro Technique: Work in 25-minute sprints with breaks to stay focused (Note: This method is Italian but widely used in productivity strategies).



A React + TypeScript project inspired by the **Kaizen Principle** — the philosophy of continuous improvement through small, consistent changes.  
This application focuses on building better habits, tracking progress, and improving productivity step by step.

**Kaizen** is a Japanese philosophy that means *“change for the better”*.  
It emphasizes:
